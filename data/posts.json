    "content": "From August 2nd to August 4th, I attended my first ever in-person hackathon with a group of friends. Amazingly, we ended up winning a major category in the hackathon. For some reason, it's always in these moments of success that I start to feel like a failure. It feels good to win the hackathon, but as weird as it sounds, I feel better for being a good teammate within my group. I wanted to be a good groupmate by cooperating well and being able to pull my own weight, and I was able to do that. Winning the hackathon also made me realize how little I know—I still have so much to learn to become an even better software developer. Even if I did win, I have to acknowledge that the work doesn’t end there. I still have to keep learning constantly and remain open to continual growth. I need to make sure that this hackathon win doesn’t inflate my ego or blind me to my flaws and the areas I need to work on. I still have so much to learn about myself, and I need to stay humble and keep an open mind. In the end, I’m grateful for the experience that HackThe6ix has given me. The opportunity to develop software with such a fun and amazing group will be a memory I will never forget. All in all, I’m just very grateful that I had the opportunity to attend the hackathon. Being able to keep learning constantly, to get 1% better every single day, is such a privilege that I’ve taken for granted time and time again. It’s truly in these moments that I realize how lucky I am—to be able to work hard and keep bettering myself every single day is something that I won’t take for granted again."

    "content": "Mastering my own ego has been something I've been struggling with for years. Thinking that I'm better than everyone else, that I'm smarter than everyone else, even though I have so much to learn, is truly a problem that I've been trying to let go of. I think of ego like a plate of armor protecting you from mental turmoil. Back then, I think I didn't know how to truly deal with criticism and failure. Because of this, I developed a thick ego to protect myself. I think the key to letting go of my ego was not only understanding myself more, but to understand how to healthily deal with failure and criticism. Once I started to focus on that, I was able to slowly let go of my ego, to make the armor of my ego thinner and thinner until the failure and criticism I was dealt was tangible to learn from effectively. Even though I'm still learning how to let go of my ego even today, I'm glad I made a conscious effort to do so. Over the past few years, I've learned and improved so much more because I could look at myself honestly and determine what I needed to learn. It's also nice to be a positive influence among everyone in my life. Letting go of my ego also allowed me to let go of my jealousy of others in an easier way. Even though I've gotten so far in my learning journey, there's still so much more I have to learn and accomplish. In the end, I hope to be a kinder, better person as I strive to get better every day."

    "content": "The more I live my life, the more I realize how lucky I am to be living the life I have. Back then, I wasn't grateful for anything. As someone with high-achieving goals, I always sulked at the fact that I couldn't get what I wanted how I wanted. Even if sometimes in life you don't get what you want, I'm so grateful for the life that I have right now. To be able to go to the University of Toronto, to be able to get an education in computer science at a recognized school really does mean the world to me. It took me so long to realize how privileged I was. I think it was due to a lack of perspective. I was so focused on what I wanted and on what I didn't have that I never realized what I already had in my life and how it was enough to satisfy me. Having this newfound appreciation really makes me realize how I take a lot of things for granted, and how lucky I am to be living my life. This realization gives me the drive to keep improving and to keep working hard. The opportunities that I currently have in my life are opportunities that I recognize I'm able to get simply because I am lucky to live such a blessed life. I'm safe, I have the agency to work hard and study hard. What more could I ask for? The ability to work on myself daily is the biggest privilege in my life that I will never take for granted ever again."

    "content": "One of the key values that I follow in my life is to learn from my mistakes as deeply and quickly as possible. Although it's hard, I acknowledge that it's a key character trait for bettering myself. Looking back on my life, I realize there were so many moments where I was blind to the mistakes that I made. This is what truly scares me the most: not realizing the mistakes you've made or the actions you've taken. Because ultimately, you won't be able to learn from them if you don't know that you've committed them in the first place. This is why I try to focus as much as possible on the ability to recognize the mistakes I've made. As weird as it sounds, it involves a lot of practice. It involves daily reflection, whether it's writing in a journal or sitting down by yourself, quietly thinking about how your day went. It involves thinking about every particular moment that happened in your day: the happy moments, the sad moments, and the worst of all, the embarrassing or hurtful moments that you want to forget instantly. As hard as it is to do this, I realize that it is these embarrassing and hurtful moments that offer you the greatest practice in your self-reflection skills. Learning how to be honest with your feelings and feeling vulnerable enough to experience these emotions is key to becoming not only self-aware but also emotionally mature, of which self-awareness is definitely a key part. I think understanding your emotions helps you understand yourself as well as the other people around you. When you understand your emotions and why you feel them, you also have a better understanding of the emotions of those around you and why other people feel the way they're feeling. As useless as this may sound to a lot of people, I believe this is a key human character trait that is so important in day-to-day life."
